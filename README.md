# Car Price Prediction

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting car prices based on various features using **Machine Learning**. It was developed using **Google Colab** for implementation and analysis.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Python**
- **Google Colab**
- **Libraries Used:**
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib.pyplot`
  - `matplotlib as mpl`

## Dataset

- **Format:** `.csv` file  
- **Description:** The dataset includes information about cars such as:
  - Brand / Model  
  - Year  
  - Engine Size  
  - Fuel Type  
  - Transmission  
  - Mileage  
  - **Price** (Target Variable)

> *The dataset was imported using `pandas` and used for training regression models to predict car prices.*

## Workflow

1. Data Loading from CSV
2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Feature Selection
5. Model Training & Evaluation
6. Price Prediction

## Output

- The model predicts the **estimated price** of a car based on its features.

## Conclusion

This project provided hands-on experience in building a **regression model** using real-world car data in `.csv` format and understanding the importance of **EDA**, **feature engineering**, and **model evaluation** in price prediction.
